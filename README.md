## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

### 1. Flask Application
The backend for this system is built using Flask, providing the logic for serving the GAN-based restoration functionality through a user-friendly web interface.

### 2. HTML Templates
HTML files are included to create an intuitive and interactive webpage where users can upload images and view the restored results.

### 3. Pre-trained GAN Model
A pre-trained model is provided to perform pixel restoration tasks. Simply deploy the application to start using the system without needing additional training.
